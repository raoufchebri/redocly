ScyllaDB is the database for data-intensive apps that require high performance and low latency.
We built our NoSQL database with a close-to-the-hardware, shared-nothing approach that optimizes raw performance, fully utilizes modern multi-core servers and minimizes the overhead to DevOps. ScyllaDB is API-compatible with both Cassandra and DynamoDB, yet is much faster, more consistent and with a lower TCO.
